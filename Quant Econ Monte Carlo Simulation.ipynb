    "But how does the computer generate these observations following uniform distributions? It turns out the numbers generated by a computer are not really random nor independent, but what we called Pseudorandom numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that they appear, for all practical purposes, to be random and independent, in the sense that they would pass various statistical tests for checking the random/independnet property. We thus can use them in our simulations as if they were truly random--and we do.\n",

    "#### Linear Congruential Generators\n",
    "The most common and easy to understand and implement random generator is called a Linear Congruential Generator (LLG) and is defined as follows:\n",
    "$$ \\begin{equation}\n",
    "Z_{n+1} = (aZ_n + c) \\text{ mod m, for } n \\geqq 0,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{equation}\n",
    "U_n = Z_n / m,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $0 < a < m$, $0 \\leqq a < m$ are constant integers, and $mod$ $m$ means the remainder if you divide $aZ_n + c$ by $m$. Thus, all the $Z_n$ fall between $0$ and $m-1$; the $U_n$ are thus between $0$ and $1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$0 \\leqq Z_0 < c$ is called the seed. $m$ is chosen to  be very large, usually of the form $m=2^{32}$ or $m=2^{64}$ because the computer architeture is based on $32$ or $64$ bits per word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a more typical example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{equation}\n",
    "Z_{n+1} = (1664525 * Z_n + 1013904223) \\text{ mod }2^{32}.\n",
    "\\end{equation} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The number $a$, $c$, $m$ must be carefully chosen to get a good random generator, in particular we would want all $c$ values $0, 1, \\ldots c-1$ to be generated in which case we say that the LLG has full period of length $c$. Such generator will cyclically run thru the numbers over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, consider\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{equation}\n",
    "Z_{n+1} = (5 * Z_n + 1) \\text{ mod 8}.\n",
    "\\end{equation} $$\n",
    "with $Z_0=0$. Then \n",
    "$(Z_0, Z_1, \\ldots,Z_7) = (0, 1, 6, 7, 4, 5, 2, 3),$\n",
    "and $Z_8$ = 16 mod 8 = 0, hence causing the sequence to repeat.\n",

    "If we increase $c$ to $c=16$, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{equation}\n",
    "Z_{n+1} = (5 * Z_n + 1) \\text{ mod 16}.\n",
    "\\end{equation} $$\n",
    "with $Z_0=0$. Then \n",
    "$(Z_0, Z_1, \\ldots,Z_15) = (0, 1, 6, 15, 12, 13, 2, 11, 8, 9, 14, 7, 4, 5, 10, 3),$\n",
    "and $Z_16$ = 16 mod 16 = 0, hence causing the sequence to repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing good numbers $a$, $c$, $m$ involves the sophisticated use of number theory; prime numbers and such, and has been extensively researched/studied by computer scientists and mathmaticians.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the numbers generated are entirely deterministic: If you know the values $a$, $c$, $m$, then once you know one value ($Z_0$, say) you know them all. But if you are handed a long sequence of the $U_n$, they certainly appear random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python currently uses the Mersenne Twister as its core random number generator: U = random.random(). It produces at double precision (64 bits), 53-bit precision (floating), and has a period of $2^{19937}-1$. The Mersenne Twister is one of the most extensively tested random number generators in exsistence. It is not a LLG, it is far more complex, but yet again is determinstic and recursive.\n",
